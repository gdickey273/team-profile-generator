  ## Usage
  
  The user can enter node app.js to start the application. The user (as the teams manager) will then be prompted for their name, email address, and office number. After that the user can choose whether or not to add another employee (as many times as they'd like). If the user is adding an Engineer, they will be prompted for the Engineer's github username. If the user is adding an Intern, they will be prompted for the Intern's school name.

  Once all information is added and the user chooses not to add any more employees, an html file will be created detailing the giveb team information.
